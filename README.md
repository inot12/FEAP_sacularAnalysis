# FEAP_sacularAnalysis

In the A_PreprocessingÌ£->SimulationsData: resultsDir has to be specified. Within all other directories will be automatically made

Py scripts made to analyze all FEAP simulations.  After finished, all FEAP simulation results are stored in notepad documents in different (sub)direcories. 
Analysis pogram is diveded into 3 parts thas has to be run (Assembing+A/B/C) separately:

1) A_Prerocessing:
  - Select sonditions, wanted Timesteps for analysis and contor plotting, direcotry and pickle names..  
  - Iterates over the main directory,gets all simulation names and paths from several different subfolders at different levels. 
  - Extract data for every simulation: With several conditions, for selected timesteps from several different files in each simulation directory.
  - Store data to pickle container 
  
2) B_ParameterCombinations:
  - Calculate known derived parameters out of basic
  - Make more than 50000 new (unknown) parameters; Every possible combination up to 3rd power using basic parameters 
  - Calculate the r value and sort parameters by condition. 
  - Write everything to Excel document
  
3) C_Postprocessing:
  - Plot outer contours for all aneurysms
  - Plot paper ready diagrams for selected parameters
  - Make statistical analysis and write it to Excel document
